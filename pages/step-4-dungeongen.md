# WORK IN PROGRESS: DO NOT READ BELOW THIS LINE OR YOU WILL LOSE BRAIN CELLS

In this step, we will be creating a random dungeon generator for our game. Things like this can be incredibly complex and involve all kinds of advanced concepts. But we will be making something that is pretty basic and easy to work with, and still produces interesting results.  

Lets get right to it! Create a new script file as `res://global/DungeonGen.gd`. As its file location suggests, this is going to be another `global script`, so remember to set this script up in Project Settings > AutoLoad as "DungeonGen". Most of this step is going to involve writing code into this new script.
